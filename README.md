# minesweeper-pygame
A PyGame implementation of minesweeper. Forked from [eivankin's repository](https://github.com/eivankin/minesweeper-pygame) to borrow their Windows XP-like GUI. The underlying code has been modified to decouple game state from the game engine itself to enable seperate analysis, as well as making game feel more similar to what you'd find at [minesweeper.online](https://minesweeper.online/).
