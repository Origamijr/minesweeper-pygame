# minesweeper-pygame
A PyGame project for Yandex Lyceum. 
I tried to make something that will look as similar as possible to game from Windows XP.
# Features
- Scaled up 2 times. Default cell size is 30px, it may be changed in future releases or may be made editable for a user.
- Original functions from Windows XP game.
- Editable game presets (field size & mines count).
# Install from source
## Requirements
Python >=3.9 is required to run this application from source.
## Installation
If there are no binaries for your platform in releases, or you want to use the latest (dev) version, you should run the game from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/eivankin/minesweeper-pygame
cd minesweeper-pygame
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
If commands "pip" and "python" are linked to Python 2 on your system, you must use "pip3" and "python3" instead.
