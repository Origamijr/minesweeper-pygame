\section{Speed}

Although maximizing efficiency is adjacent to maximizing completion speed, efficiency only partially captures what a speed player would want.\\

In addition to minimizing clicks, to maximize speed one would also want to reduce guessing time, number of guesses, and the amount that one has to move the mouse.\\

TODO

\begin{itemize}
    \item don't flag every known mine
    \item memorize more patterns
    \item guess slightly more aggressively if it allows for less mouse movement
    \item play with efficiency in mind
\end{itemize}
