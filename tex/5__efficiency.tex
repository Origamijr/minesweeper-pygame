\chapter{Efficiency}\label{sec:efficiency}

Up to now, are discussion has been about maximizing the win rate of playing minesweeper. However, the objective of most players is not to have the highest win rate, but to have the fastest clear time. In the pursuit of completing the game the fastest, an often considered intermediate goal is to minimize the number of clicks that you use to complete a board. This intermediate goal has eventually turned by the community into a possible end goal in of itself. In order to measure how good a player has used clicks, we use a metric called efficiency.\\

tbh, it'd be difficult for me at the moment to do much better than Danoouch on providing tangible tips for this topic. Until I do more experimentation and math, please just refer to her guide\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BBa4YgPucipQFE8jCYRE83y2iDzCE-71FZP7J_GXU6M/edit}}
