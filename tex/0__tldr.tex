\section*{TL;DR if you're new}

This is minesweeper\\

This is a mine. They occupy some spaces of the board.\\

Play by clicking squares. Numbers say how many of the neighboring squares (including diagonals) have mines.\\

Win by uncovering all squares without mines.\\

I strongly encourage you to play and learn the game yourself. IMO this is the best way to have fun playing minesweeper.
