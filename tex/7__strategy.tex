\chapter{Strategy}

In the end, we want to know how to be better at playing minesweeper. Everything in this document has been leading up to this chapter, where we now discuss what a player should actually do in game to be better.\\

An interesting thing about minesweeper is that there are multiple things a player may want to optimize. For this chapter, I will look at four common objectives: winrate, efficiency, speed, and difficulty. These objectives are loosely defined as follows:\begin{itemize}
    \item Winrate: Win games as often as possible
    \item Efficiency: Win using as few clicks as possible
    \item Speed: Win as fast as possible
    \item Difficulty: Win the hardest board possible
\end{itemize}

Keep in mind though that I, myself, am not the best minesweeper player\footnote{My online profile: \url{https://minesweeper.online/player/1896875}}. Top players frankly seem inhuman to me in terms of their performance, and I can't tell if the difference is due to my faulty strategy (in which much of this section should be ignored), or just a skill issue on my part. I do think I am a competent enough player to at least give some insight on strategy though for beginners and people with lower numbers than myself.\\

TODO. Finish coding algorithms in Chapter 6 first to do strategy analysis using them.\\
