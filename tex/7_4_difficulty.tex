\section{Difficulty}

Compared to the other three objectives, maximizing difficulty may be the most difficult (lol) objective to quantify. Although one would want to maximize the win rate on a difficult board, this may result in a very large expected play time. Instead, players that aim to complete high difficulty boards aim to minimize the expected time to obtain a win.\\

for high diff
- take forced guess as soon as you find it
- find logic and complex patterns
- guess better spots, consider safety and progress
- simplify real board and try to calculate safety if possible
- take more aggressive guess when you have less progress
