\chapter{Conclusion}

In case it isn't clear by the length of this document, minesweeper is a very complicated game to perfect. Although I try to cover everything I know about minesweeper math and strategy, there are still many topics which I am unaware of, or I don't feel I have the expertise to go into further detail about. Also, a lot of discussion of minesweeper theory and computer algorithms has been left out intentionally as this document was limited to discussion that can further human play. All in all, there is a lot to be said about this game and a lot more to explore.\\
