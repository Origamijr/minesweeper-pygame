\section{Efficient Guessing}

While the previous section explored what optimal efficiency for a given complete board looks like, its formulation is dependent on what is known as unfair prior knowledge. This is often abbreviated as UPK. This is because the ZiNi algorithms all have complete knowledge of the board, yielding an exact measure of how much clear progress a click will yield. While actually playing a game however, much of the board is typically unknown. For this reason, we'll need to explore how a guess can be made to optimize efficiency.\\


TODO. This is likely going to need another analysis similar to optimal guessing for win rate, but with a modified reward function. This will lead to an entirely different set of heuristics as one may expect.\\
