\section{Efficiency}

\iffalse
While Chapter \ref{sec:efficiency} goes into a lot of detail on how to maximize efficiency, an efficiency player's goal is not always necessarily to maximize efficiency. Although this statement may seem contradictory, one will need to consider that maximizing efficiency drastically comes at the cost of winrate. Unless the objective really is to maximize efficiency completely abandoning all notions of a win rate, many players want a balance between efficiency and winrate.\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Restart until you get a good amount of openings in the corners
    \item Try to chord if and only if doing so clears $\geq2$ squares
    \item Guess with the anticipation of openings
\end{itemize}
