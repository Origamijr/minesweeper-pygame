\chapter{Guessing}\label{sec:guessing}

Last section explored how you can decide to clear or flag a square with certainty. However, in the course of play, you will often find yourself in a situation where it is impossible to determine what the next action should be with certainty.\\

In these situations, it is necessary for a player to guess a square to clear in an attempt to gain more information. As one would expect, not all guesses are made equal. This section will attempt to explore the question of what guess should be made if the objective is to maximize the chance of winning.\\
